        <h3>tuition fee</h3>
        <p>Tuition fee in 2 components, payable annually and term wise, has to be paid every year for every child. For example, a Jr KG child will have to pay Rs 2,09,000 per annum as per the current fee structure.</p>
        <h3>refund of fee</h3>
        <p>Fee paid at the time of taking admission cannot be refunded even if the child does not attend school after taking admission.</p>
        <h3>fee hikes </h3>
        <p>Manthan is committed to run the schools with very high ethical standards and intends to revise the fee only to meet its expenses on account of pay hikes to teachers and other expenses. From the last 7 years, it is observed that this is 10%. There will be no sharp increase in the fee that causes immense hardship to parents budgets. However pl note that in the year when your child moves to Class 1 or 6 or 9 your fee will go up by about 20 to 25% because of the fee slab change effect along with the fee hike of 10%. Fee slabs differ for pre-primary, primary, middle, high school as the expenses incurred on account of having experienced teachers, learning resources, labs, etc go up significantly in the higher grades. 11th and 12th grades are in a completely different league with respect to expenses, however, we kept the fee very low compared to all other schools offering A levels.</p>
        <h3>exam fee</h3>
        <p>Fee payable to any external agencies conducting exams like CIE, CBSE, Asset, Checkpoint, etc are not included in the above fee. Each of these agencies publish their fee every year before the exam and CIE fee is subject to pound rupee exchange rate too. These will be intimated separately depending on the communication from the agencies. Students from grades 3 to 10 take Asset every year, the exam fee is about Rs 500. Children of grades 5 and 8 take Checkpoint which is conducted by Cambridge and its expensive but compulsory for all children, anywhere between Rs 5 to 10 thousand. Children in 8, 9 & 10 take the board exams conducted by CBSE and CIE. While CBSE exam fee is very nominal in hundreds CIE exam fee is very expensive, it could be close to a lakh.</p>
        <h3>method of payment</h3>
        <p>Fee can to be paid through direct online transfer or through depositing of cheques/cash in the designated branches of HDFC bank and only against an invoice provided by the school.</p>
